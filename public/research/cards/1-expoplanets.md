There is a hunger for knowing whether we are alone in the Universe. This curiosity drives the
exoplanet community to characterize planets outside our Solar system in order to get a picture
of other worlds. 

Astronomers have made tremendous achievements to find and characterize exoplanets using a wide variety of methods. The complexity of exoplanet interior characteri-
zation demands interdisciplinary collaboration in order for the field to reach its potential role
in characterizing planets. My research advances the characterization of both individual planets and planet distributions.
