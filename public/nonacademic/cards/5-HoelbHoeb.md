I am very thankful to the artist duo *hoelb/hoeb*. They are such an inspirational source for me. In 2016 and 2017, I had the pleasure to take part in two of their projects: *Training* and *LOST_INN*.

*hoelb/hoeb* offer visitors surprising new perspective with their experimental arrangements and dare to elucidate our understandings of charity, care, and humanity.
