## Lectures & Workshops

![image alt title](/images/small/frankpowers.jpg)

I have given lectures for diverse audiences in natural science and art. Here, I reveal the ones that were meant for the art & design audience:

I gave my lecture *Introduction to Life on Earth, Astrobiology & the Diversity of Planets* at ZHdK. The workshop *Performance Stage - Performance Space: COSMIC SOUP / SPACE STAGE* was done for the art performance class of HKB, and my workshop on *Planetary Thinking* was done for HyperWerk Basel.
