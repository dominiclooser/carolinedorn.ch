I have given lectures for diverse audiences in natural science and art.

I am invited to give a lecture during the Astrophysical Origins: Pathways from Star Formation to Habitable Planets Program at the Erwin Schroedinger Institute for Mathematics and Physics at the University of Vienna.

I gave my lecture "Introduction to Life on Earth, Astrobiology & the Diversity of Planets" at ZHdK. The workshop "Performance Stage - Performance Space: COSMIC SOUP / SPACE STAGE" was done for the art performance class of HKB, and my workshop on "Planetary Thinking" was done for HyperWerk Basel.
