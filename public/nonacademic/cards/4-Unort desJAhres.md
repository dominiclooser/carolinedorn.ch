Together with LitUp! and [ResPublik](https://www.respublik.ch/), we asked the public to vote for the *Unort* (non-place) of Zurich 2017. 

What is an *Unort*? 

Each individual nomination offers its own answer to this question: what does the *Un-* stand for? And declares *Un-* always something bad? The winning *Unort* illustrates the most convincing concept for aptitudes and inaptitudes of Zurich's urban planning.
