Together with LitUp!, we have created a Interdisciplinary Space Station during the science festival *100 ways of thinking* of the University of Zürich at the Kunsthalle of the Löwenbräu-Areal. We have created and explored far away worlds and planets with our collective expertise in politics, philosophy, astronomy, poetry, human being..
